Packages in R are collections of functions and/or data that are bundled up for easy
distribution, and installing a package will extend the functionality of R on your com‐
puter. If an R user creates a package and thinks that it might be useful for others, that
user can distribute it through a package repository. The primary repository for distrib‐
uting R packages is called **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network), but there
are others, such as Bioconductor and Omegahat.

Use **install.packages()** and give it the name of the package you want to install.

Sample Code for installation of package.

```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

If RStudio is installed you can select the packages to be installed by selecting the checkbox in the packages window and select install option
