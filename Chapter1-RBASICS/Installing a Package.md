Packages in R are collections of functions and/or data that are bundled up for easy
distribution, and installing a package will extend the functionality of R on your com‐
puter. If an R user creates a package and thinks that it might be useful for others, that
user can distribute it through a package repository. The primary repository for distrib‐
uting R packages is called CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network), but there
are others, such as Bioconductor and Omegahat.

Use install.packages() and give it the name of the package you want to install.

Sample Code for installation of package.

```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
